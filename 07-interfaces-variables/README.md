# Class 7: Interfaces and Variables (and other relationships between classes)

## Agenda
- Announcements
  - none?
- Code review
- Daily Systems: files and the filesystem
- Warmup questions
- Lecture
- Lab intro

## Warmup Questions
1. What's the difference between an interface and a parent class?
2. What are some different relationships that can exist between different classes?
3. What's a `toString` method?

## Learning Objectives
1. The student will understand the difference between inheritance and interfaces.
2. The student will be able to set up a hierarchy of classes that both inherit from a base class and implement at least one interface.
