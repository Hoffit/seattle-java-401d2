# Midterm Project Requirements

Your midterm project must use Java to build an interesting, well-thought-out, complete application.

Specifically, you must:

1. Build a RESTful API
    - Models
        - At least 2 Models
        - Dependency Injection for testing
        - At least 1 "Service"
        - At least 1 interface
    - Views
        - Can be for HTML, JSON, or any combination of the two
    - Controllers
        - At least 2 Controllers
    - Auth using Spring
    - Exception: if you really want to build something hardware-related instead of a web app


2. Documentation (README)
    - Provide documentation for your web app. Include
      the workflow, screenshots of the app, DB Schema, and basic
      functionality directions on how to use the site.

3. Testing:
  - Unit Tests
	- Getters/Setters
	- API Endpoints
	- CRUD operations

4. Clearly commented code
	- Clearly document your code
	- What does this code do?
	- Why do you have it?
	- Where is the request being sent?
	- What is the request's expected response?

5. Database
  - PostgresQL
  - At least 2 tables
  - Digital DB Schema (should be present in your Readme)
	- No Whiteboard images allowed.
  - Associations clearly defined

6. Deployment
  - Heroku (recommended)
  - AWS
  - Docker
